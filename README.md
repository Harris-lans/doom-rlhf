# Doom RLHF (WIP)

This is my final project for my Bachelor's degree. This will investigate the impact of human feedback on reinforcement learning, particularly on training efficiency and quality. To accomplish this, I will compare two AI systems: one that uses traditional reinforcement learning and another that incorporates a reward function learned from human gameplay before further refining it with traditional reinforcement learning. Both systems will play levels in the popular game Doom using the ViZDoom tool, relying only on the game's visual input.
